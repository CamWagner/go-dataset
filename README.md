# Fox Go Dataset
This repository contains 13.6 million [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) games, downloaded from all ranks on the [Fox Go server](http://www.foxwq.com/). They should be useful for designing AIs that play with human style at a specific level, or for reviewing games of a specific level.

The download process took a few hours, and is not the complete Fox Game database. Open the archives with [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/). The archives may be downloaded individually from their folders, since the total repository size is large.
