# Fox Go Dataset
This repository contains 13.6 million [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) games, downloaded from all ranks on the [Fox Go server](http://www.foxwq.com/). They should be useful for designing AIs that play with human style at a specific level, or for reviewing games of a specific level.

The download process took a few hours, and was halted before it downloaded the entire Fox Go dataset. Open the archives with [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/). Make sure to use the Extract button instead of drag and drop. The total repository size is 4 GB. Archives may also be downloaded individually.
